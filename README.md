# Welcome to my Master's project: Machine Learning & Blended Wing Body

Results will be posted after defense on the 17th of January 2018.

The general aim of the project is to engineer a lightweight vertical take-off and landing unmanned aerial vehicle with an autonomous control system and a brain-computer interface.

## Within the scope of the thesis the following subtasks were solved:

### 1. Research and compare existing VTOL and BCI solutions

### 2. Engineer the structure, electronics and propulsion system of the drone

### 3. Optimize the aerodynamics of the drone using Bayesian optimization with Predictive Entropy Search Multi-objective Optimizer

### 4. Develop an EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) control system

## The following tasks are currently under development outside the scope of the thesis:

### 1. Build the drone 

### 2. Set up an autonomous flight system
* Set up Raspberry Pi based autopilot system.
* Test autopilot.

### 3. Building a feature recognition system
* Set up camera and telemetry system for BB UAV.
* Set up software to recognize a 2m x 2m blanket as target for landing or package drop.

This page is dedicated to my Master's Thesis project.
The aim of the project is to apply Machine Learning algorithms to enhance the development and usage of a lightweight Blended Wing Body (BWB) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). 

The subtasks of the project can be listed as following:

## 1. Develop a policy to aerodynamically engineer a BWB
* Developing an Evolutionary Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization system.
* Create a Pareto non-dominated vector of Bezier curve based airfoils.
* Use the non-dominated airfoils in coeffect with the bodies global parameters (e.g span, taper and sweep) to find a global approximate optimal solution with a Panel Method based system.
* Find a local optimal solution using OpenFOAM/SU2 based Computational Fluid Dynamics softare.
* Test optimized wing.

## 2. Set up electronics and navigation system
* Parametrize propulsion and control surface system to project requirements.
* Set up Raspberry Pi based autopilot system.
* Test autopilot.

## 3. Develop autonomous Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) Policy
* Set up a Deep Q Learning (or other) based reinforcement training policy.
* Initial data collection of operator controlling vertical hovering and VTOL of the BWB with a RC control.
* Controlled environment training of vertical hovering and VTOL.
* Outdoor environment training of VTOL and tests.

## 4. Building a feature recognition system
* Set up camera and telemetry system for BB UAV.
* Set up software to recognize a 2m x 2m blanket as target for landing or package drop.

## 5. SDevelop EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) control system
* Set up communications with EPOC EMOTIV
* Set up neural data transformation pipeline
* Benchmark classification algorithms with crossvalidation:

	a) Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
	
	b) Ensemble Methods (EM)

	c) Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)

* Choose and combine (if necessary) classification algorithms
* Test BCI system
* Set up communications with BWB UAV
* Set up transformation and classification pipeline on UAV onboard computer
